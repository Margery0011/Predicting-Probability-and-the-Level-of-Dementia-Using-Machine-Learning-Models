# Predicting-Probability-and-the-Level-of-Dementia-Using-Machine-Learning-Models
Dementia is a general term for a decline in mental ability severe enough to interfere with daily life. Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) is a global rating scale for staging patients diagnosed with dementia. In her project, she is using Cross-Sectional and longitudinal OASIS MRI structural and demographic data to train machine learning models to predict if and at what level an individual has dementia. This problem is formulated as a binary classification problem (CDR = 0 and CDR > 0) and a multiclass problem (CDR = 0, CDR = 0.5, CDR = 1).  

# Background
### Dementia

Dementia is not a specific disease. It is an overall term for impaired ability to remember, think, or make decisions that interferes with doing everyday activities. Though dementia mostly affects older adults, it is not a part of normal aging.
### Clinical Dementia Rating(CDR):

CDR is a global rating scale for staging patients diagnosed with dementia. It evaluates cognitive, behavioral, and functional aspects of Alzheimer disease and other dementias. In this project  Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) values provided in the data set will be used as "targets" for training the classification models. 

# Dataset

Combined Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal data  from OASIS  brain project (http://www.oasis-brains.org/) to train machine learning models

Cross-Sectional dataset consists of a cross-sectional collection for 436 persons including male and female.For each person, 3 to 4 T1-weighted MRI scans that were obtained in single scan sessions are included.
Longitudinal dataset  consists of a longitudinal collection of 373 subjects aged 60 to 96. Each subject was scanned on two or more visits, here we only use their first visit result. 

After concating , there are 809 subjects in total.

## Inputs(Features) and Outputs(Targets)

I am using 8 features as input and CDR as the output to train these models, the descriptions are summaried in the table below.

## Data Pre-process

### Import Libraries 

```

### Load 2 Datasets & concat them
```
cross = pd.read_csv("oasis_cross-sectional.csv")
long =  pd.read_csv("oasis_longitudinal.csv")
cross_cp = cross.copy()
long_cp = long.copy()
```

Remove unnecessary columns 
```
cross_cp.drop(columns=['ID','Delay'],inplace=True)
long_cp = long.rename(columns={'EDUC':'Educ'})
long_cp.drop(columns=['Subject ID','MRI ID','Group','Visit','MR Delay'],inplace=True)
data = pd.concat([cross_cp,long_cp])
```

### Data Clean

- Unnecessary data removal:
  - Rows missing CDR value (608 subjects remained)
  - ASF column : Because it is almost correlated with factor eTIV (99%)

  - Hand column: All right-handed, not representative
- Missing values imputer
  - SES

  Because SES is discrete data, so use "most_frequent as strategy , and MMSE is not normal distributionï¼Œ so use "median" as strategy
  - MMSE

```
data_cp = data.copy()
# remove ASF column because it is almost correlated with eTIV 
# remove hand column
data_cp.drop(['ASF'],axis = 1,inplace = True)
data_cp.drop(['Hand'],axis = 1,inplace = True)
imputer = SimpleImputer ( missing_values = np.nan,strategy='most_frequent')
imputer.fit(data_cp[['SES']])
data_cp[['SES']] = imputer.fit_transform(data_cp[['SES']])

# missing values imputer 
imputer = SimpleImputer ( missing_values = np.nan,strategy='median')
imputer.fit(data_cp[['MMSE']])
data_cp[['MMSE']] = imputer.fit_transform(data_cp[['MMSE']])
```
Change  "Gender" from categorical data to numerica data

```
gender_map = {'M':0, 'F':1}
data_cp['Gender'] = data_cp['M/F'].map(gender_map)
data_cp.drop(['M/F'],axis=1,inplace= True)
```


# Binary Classification

To predict whether this individual has dementia by Binary classifier, if the outout of target is 0 means "CDR = 0" and this individual is "Non-Dementia" , if the outout of target is 1 means "CDR > 0" and this individual is "Dementia" 

```
data_cp['CDR'] = data_cp['CDR'].astype(str)
data_cp['CDR'] = data_cp['CDR'].str.replace('2','1')
data_bi = data_cp.copy()
ClassDict = {'0.0':0,'0.5':1,'1.0':1}
data_bi.loc[:,'CDR'] = data_bi.loc[:, 'CDR'].apply(lambda x: ClassDict[x])
```

For Male, most number of dementia cases are reported in the age of around 80 .
For Female, dementia is prevalent in 70 years of Age.Most of the cases happens generally after 65 years of age

## RandomForest Classifier Tuning

Random forest is an ensemble tool which takes a subset of observations and a subset of variables to build a decision trees. It builds multiple such decision tree and amalgamate them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction.

### Find best n_estimator

```
scorel = []
for i in range(1,100):
    rfc = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=i,
                                 n_jobs=-1,
                                 random_state=42)
    score = cross_val_score(rfc,X_bi, Y_bi,cv=3).mean()
    scorel.append(score)

print(max(scorel),([*range(1,100)][scorel.index(max(scorel))]))
plt.figure(figsize=[20,5])
plt.plot(range(1,100),scorel)
plt.xlabel("n_estimator")
plt.ylabel("accuracy")
plt.show()
```

The figure shows that when n_estimator = 69 , the model can get best accuracy.

#### Hyperparameter Optimization for the RandomForest Model

Use Grid Search to search optimal values for hyperparameters. To tune hyperparameters, follow the steps below:

- Create a model instance of the RandomForest Model
- Specify hyperparameters with all possible values
- Define performance evaluation metrics
- Apply cross-validation
- Train the model using the training dataset
- Determine the best values for the hyperparameters given.

**GridSearcgCV()**

It is Exhaustive search method.After we created a list of hyperparameters dictionary , it will find the optimal paramters among all candidate parameter choices, by looping through, trying every possibility, then the best performing parameter is the final result.

Then build the classifier using these best parameters selected by grid search.

# Model Performance Evaluation

For Binary Classification, the output is either Non-Dementia (0) or Dementia (1)

**Confusion Matrix**

True positive (TP): Prediction is 1 and X is Dementia, we want that
True negative (TN): Prediction is 0 and X is Non-Dementia, we want that too
False positive (FP): Prediction is 1 and X is Non-Dementia, false alarm, bad
False negative (FN): Prediction is 0 and X is Dementia, the worst

**Precision**

The ratio of accurately predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations.

Precision = TP/TP+FP

**Recall**

The ratio of accurately predicted positive observations to all observations in actual class â€“ yes.

Recall = TP/TP+FN

**F1 score** 

It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It takes both false positive and false negatives into account.F1 Score is the weighted average of Precision and Recall. Therefore, this score takes both false positives and false negatives into account.


F1 Score = 2(Recall * Precision) / (Recall + Precision)

## Random Forest Classifier Performance Report


## Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is used to solve classification problems. Models are trained on historical labelled datasets and aim to predict which category new observations will belong to. Logistic regression is well suited when we need to predict a binary answer (only 2 possible values like yes or no).

**Why Scale ?**

- Make sure features are on a similar scale

For example, if we were to make a regression on the population, the regression coefficients would differ considerably between the dimensions of "number" and "million"

#### Find the best Threshold

The output of a Logistic regression model is a probability. We can select a threshold value. If the probability is greater than this threshold value, the event is predicted positive otherwise it is predicted negative.

In binary classification, when a model gives us a score instead of the prediction itself, we usually need to convert this score into a prediction applying a threshold, the default threshold for sklearn is 0.5

### Oversample

use Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique(SMOTE) to accomplish oversample, the basic idea of the SMOTE algorithm is to analyze the minority class samples and artificially synthesize new samples based on the minority class samples to add to the dataset


```
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
oversample =SMOTE()
X_re,Y_re = oversample.fit_resample(X_train,Y_train)
Y_reD = pd.DataFrame(Y_re, columns = ['CDR'])
```
After re-sample, the distribution of data has become even
