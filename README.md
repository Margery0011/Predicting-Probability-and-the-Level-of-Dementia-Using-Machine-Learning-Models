# Predicting-Probability-and-the-Level-of-Dementia-Using-Machine-Learning-Models
Dementia is a general term for a decline in mental ability severe enough to interfere with daily life. Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) is a global rating scale for staging patients diagnosed with dementia. In her project, she is using Cross-Sectional and longitudinal OASIS MRI structural and demographic data to train machine learning models to predict if and at what level an individual has dementia. This problem is formulated as a binary classification problem (CDR = 0 and CDR > 0) and a multiclass problem (CDR = 0, CDR = 0.5, CDR = 1).
